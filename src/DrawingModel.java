/**
 * This is the model that holds the state of the drawing, and will probably be the most complex class.  
 * It should maintain a collection of Shapes. The model should look at all of the shapes as having just a Shape type. 
 * It should not have to distinguish between Triangles and Squares (and other types of shapes if you have them). 
 * When requested by a view, the model should make a deep copy of the collection of its shapes 
 * ( use the deep copy method of the Shape interface implemented in the Triangle and Square classes). 
 * Other behaviors it should support are
 * A client should be able to add a Shape to the model
 *A viewer should be able to register with the model
 * It should notify all viewers when something in the model changes.  (For now, the only changes will be when a new shape is added to the drawing.)
